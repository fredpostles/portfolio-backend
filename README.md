# Portfolio backend

## NodeJS backend built using Express framework and Mongoose to query MongoDB collection on MongoDB Atlas.

### This backend is for my [portfolio site](https://github.com/fredpostles/portfolio).

Simple backend which handles contact form submission and stores messages on MongoDB. Currently just has one route, but designed so that I can expand in future as needed.

### To do:

- Expand backend to feature:
  - admin user that can view user messages and reply
  - ability to add a project, including uploading images
